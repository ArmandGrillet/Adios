            What is Adios?
        </h1>
        <p>
        Adios is an advertisement blocker, it hides ads and block malicious scripts when you're browsing the Web using Safari. Adios also improves your browsing experience by blocking advertisement downloads, saving battery life and data consumption.

            How does it work?
        </h1>
        <p>
        Adios manages a list of ad filters, it needs to download and process them in order to work. You need to configure Adios in order to block ads.

            It's not working, what to do?
        </h1>
        <p>
            Adios only works on iPhone 5s or more recent, iPad mini 2 or more recent, iPad Air or more recent and iPod touch 6.
            <br>
            If you still see ads, check that Adios is activated in Settings > Safari > Content blockers and restart the configuration.
            <br>
            If you still have a problem, please send a private message to the Twitter account @Adios_app.
