            Why do Adios needs background updates?
        </h1>
        <p>
            To block the freshest ads, Adios needs to update its lists frequently. Background updates only happen when your device is ready (e.g. when your device is charging) and are necesarry to keep Adios effective. You can update the lists manually by tapping the last update date on the home screen.
        </p>
        <h1>
            Can I configure Adios more precisely?
        </h1>
        <p>
            If you want to select which lists to apply, long press the button "Configure Adios" on the home screen.
            <br>
            If you want to deactivate Adios for a website, add it to your whitelist by tapping the icon in the  upper-left corner of the home screen.
