            What is Adios?
        </h1>
        <p>
        Adios is an advertisement blocker, it hides ads and blocks malicious scripts when you're browsing the Web using Safari. Adios also improves your browsing experience by blocking advertisement downloads, saving battery life and data consumption.
        </p>
        <h1>
            How does it work?
        </h1>
        <p>
            Adios manages a list of ad filters, it needs to download and process it in order to work. You need to configure Adios so that it can block ads.
        </p>
        <h1>
            It's not working, what to do?
        </h1>
        <p>
            Adios only works on iPhone 5s or more recent, iPad mini 2 or more recent, iPad Air or more recent and iPod Touch 6.
            <br>
            If you still see ads, check that Adios is activated in Settings > Safari > Content blockers and restart the configuration.
            <br>
            If you still have a problem, please send a private message to the Twitter account @Adios_app.
        </p>
        <h1>
            Why does Adios need background updates?
        </h1>
        <p>
            To block the freshest ads, Adios needs to update its lists frequently. Background updates only happen when your device is ready (e.g. when your device is charging) and are necessary to keep Adios effective. You can update the lists manually by tapping the last update on the home screen.
        </p>
        <h1>
            Can I configure Adios more precisely?
        </h1>
        <p>
            If you want to select which lists to apply, long press the "Configure Adios" button on the home screen.
            <br>
            If you want to deactivate Adios for a specific website, add that website to your whitelist by tapping the icon in the upper-left corner of the home screen.
